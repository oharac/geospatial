### Set up packages and data from earlier episodes:
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

Context:

* Find the height of trees in a portion of the Harvard Forest LTER site from lidar digital surface and digital terrain models.

Objectives:

* Familiarity with raster spatial data format including CRS
* simple spatial analysis using raster math
* more efficient spatial analysis using raster::overlay()
* writing results to GeoTIFF

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('lidarTree-height.png')
```

Load in the rasters from Github repo
``` {r}
# DSM data for Harvard Forest
dsm_harv <- raster(here('data/dsm_harv_crop.tif'))
# DTM data for Harvard Forest
dtm_harv <- raster(here('data/dtm_harv_crop.tif'))
```

```{r}
plot(dsm_harv, main = 'dsm')
plot(dtm_harv, main = 'dtm')
```

A raster is a list (vector) of values, arranged into a grid, with some geospatial information attached to that grid to locate it in space.

Examine the attributes of the two data rasters
```{r}
dsm_harv; dtm_harv
```




We can also compare the rasters using `raster::compareRaster()`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?compareRaster
compareRaster(dsm_harv, dtm_harv)
compareRaster(dsm_harv, dtm_harv, values = TRUE)
```

We will use two ways to calculate the CHM model: "raster math" and the `overlay()` function.

Raster math is like vector math:
``` {r}
x <- values(dsm_harv)
head(x)

y <- x[1:20]
y
y * 2
y^2
log(y)
```

Just as you can do math on a vector, you can do math on rasters:
``` {r}
dsm_harv
dsm_harv * 2
```

Let's calculate a canopy height model using raster math, by subtracting the terrain model from the surface model:
``` {r}
chm_harv <- dsm_harv - dtm_harv
chm_harv

plot(chm_harv)
```

Let's use `writeRaster` to write our results to a file
```{r}
?writeRaster
writeRaster(chm_harv, filename = 'chm_harv.tif',
            format = 'GTiff',
            overwrite = TRUE,
            NAflag = -9999)
```

To plot using `ggplot()`, need to convert the raster to a data frame:
``` {r}
chm_harv_df <- as.data.frame(chm_harv, xy = TRUE)

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = chm_harv_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = layer)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = 'Canopy height, m', 
                       colors = c('brown', 'lightgreen', 'darkgreen')) +
  coord_quickmap() +
  theme_void()

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = chm_harv_df, aes(layer))
```

### Challenge: 
### It’s often a good idea to explore the range of values in a raster dataset 
### just like we might explore a dataset that we collected in the field.

### * What is the min and maximum value for the Harvard Forest Canopy Height 
###   Model (CHM_HARV) that we just created?
### * What are two ways you can check this range of data for CHM_HARV?
### * What is the distribution of all the pixel values in the CHM?
### * Plot a histogram with 6 bins instead of the default and change the color 
###   of the histogram.
### * Plot the CHM_HARV raster using breaks that make sense for the data. 
###   Include an appropriate color palette for the data, plot title and no axes 
###   ticks / labels.




### Challenge:
### Data are often more interesting and powerful when we compare them across 
### various locations. Let’s compare some data collected over Harvard Forest 
### to data collected in Southern California. The NEON San Joaquin Experimental
### Range (SJER) field site located in Southern California has a very different
### ecosystem and climate than the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site in 
### Massachusetts.

### Import the SJER DSM and DTM raster files and create a Canopy Height Model. 
### Then compare the two sites. Be sure to name your R objects and outputs
### carefully, as follows: objectType_SJER (e.g. DSM_SJER). This will help you 
### keep track of data from different sites!
  
### You should have the DSM and DTM data for the SJER site already loaded 
### from the Plot Raster Data in R episode.) Don’t forget to check the CRSs 
### and units of the data.
### * Create a CHM from the two raster layers and check to make sure the data 
###   are what you expect.
### * Plot the CHM from SJER.
### * Export the SJER CHM as a GeoTIFF.
### * Compare the vegetation structure of the Harvard Forest and San Joaquin 
###   Experimental Range.
