### Set up packages and data from earlier episodes:
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Context:

* Find the height of trees in a portion of the Harvard Forest LTER site using lidar digital surface and digital terrain models.

### Objectives:

* Gain familiarity with raster spatial data format
* Perform simple spatial analysis using raster math
* Write results to GeoTIFF
* Plot results using base plot and ggplot

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('lidar_pic.png')
```

Load in the rasters from Github repo
``` {r}
# DSM data for Harvard Forest
dsm <- raster('data/dsm_harv_crop.tif')
# DTM data for Harvard Forest
dtm <- raster('data/dtm_harv_crop.tif')
```

```{r}
plot(dsm, main = 'dsm')
plot(dtm, main = 'dtm')
hist(dsm); hist(dtm)
```

A raster is a set of values, arranged into a grid, with some geospatial information attached to that grid to locate it in space.

Examine the attributes of the two data rasters:
```{r}
dsm; dtm
```

We will use "raster math" to calculate the CHM model.  Raster math is like vector math, because raster values are basically vectors in disguise:
``` {r}
x <- 1:10
x^2 + 5
log(x)

x <- values(dsm)
y <- values(dtm)
head(x); head(y)

head(x - y)
```

Just as you can do math on a vector, you can do math on rasters:
``` {r}
dsm
dsm * 3.281 ### convert elevation in meters to feet
log(dsm)
```

Let's calculate a canopy height model using raster math, by subtracting the terrain model from the surface model:
``` {r}
chm <- dsm - dtm
chm

plot(chm)
hist(chm)
```

Let's use `writeRaster` to write our results to a file
```{r}
# ?writeRaster
writeRaster(chm, filename = 'chm_harv.tif',
            format = 'GTiff',
            overwrite = TRUE)
```

To plot using `ggplot()`, need to convert the raster to a data frame:
``` {r}
chm_df <- as.data.frame(chm, xy = TRUE)

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = chm_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = layer)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = 'Canopy height, m', 
                       colors = c('brown', 'lightgreen', 'darkgreen')) +
  coord_quickmap() +
  theme_void()

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = chm_df, aes(layer))
```

### Review

* Basic familiarity with raster format
* Introduction to raster math
* Reading, writing, plotting rasters
